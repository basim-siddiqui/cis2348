This folder contains the Python programs for the final project. 
The first program that should be ran is the reports program, which takes input from three files: ManufacturerList.csv, PriceList.csv, and ServiceDatesList.csv.
The outputted files from this program are used for the inventory query program.
The query asks for input from the user to ouput the search results and recommended product.
Programs are written by Basim Siddiqui and are evaluated by CIS 2348 TAs.
